GPL3 means if you use this, and make any changes to it, and then 
redistribute that new work, YOUR new work; you must register those 
changes on github as a pull request to me<Ruckusist;eric.alphagriffin@gmail.com> 
and be verified by email as certified GPL compliant.

If no changes are made. have at thee to redistribute.

Mods are not considered changes to the Core and thus can be kept
propritary.

Proper use case: Make a cool mod, then redistribute the core, with 
your cool mod. Dont change the core without a pull request. have fun.

Improper use case: Make a million dollars on a cool VPN that can only
be used from this interface/framework/engine AND THEN change the core
to a barely recognizable version of itself. albiet awesomely better,
if you started where i left off... and didnt tell me. You are gonna be
bummed when i find out about it. 'Cause thats the law.
*Obviously sending proper pull requests mitigates all damages.
